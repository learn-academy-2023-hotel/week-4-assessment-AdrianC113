# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: The virtual DOM in React acts as a background system that scans through all state and prop changes to the code. The changes are then implemented in the virtual DOM, ensures that it is running correctly, and then transfers it to the actual DOM for re-rendering. This process updates the code behind the scenes and mitigates the need to update the DOM directly, which avoids suboptimal performances.

Researched answer: Virtual DOM in React is a virtual representation of the real DOM. The "diffing" occurs which means a copy of the updated and current version of the DOM are compared. Once the diffing is completed, the update is then sent to the original DOM to be re-rendered and implemented. 

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Ruby's implicit return means returning the last value in a block of code without having to use the "return" call. It is "implied" that the last line is what needs to be returned.

Researched answer: Implicit returns in Ruby is done when an explicit return is not established. Implicit return is when the code returns the last truthy value in a code. 

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: 
Common:
- The structure of the code are similar in both Ruby and Javascript
- Both languages use Arrays in the code
- Both can be used for backend development

Differences:
- Content of the structure differs, Ruby's code eliminates the confusing syntax that Javascript uses ei. the {} and => etc.
- Javascript uses functions while Ruby uses methods
- Javascript has 7 data types while Ruby only has 4

Researched answer: 
Common: Both Javascript and Ruby are object oriented languages. They can both create variables and classes in order to be called on. Additionally, both languages have active supporting communities and large libaries to download.

Differences: Javascript and Ruby differ in syntax and variable declaration. Ruby is more strict on their scoping rules compared to javascript. Javascript can be used within the browser and instantly see changes whereas Ruby cannot.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: Version manager allows the use of different languages within one coding platform. It lets you switch from one language to the other depending on the needs of the client or website being developed.

Researched answer: Version manager is a tool used to manage multiple langauges, frameworks, and installed libraries in one system. This ensures that each project is provided with the specific coding language that it requires without having to switch systems providing isolated and organized development environments.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: Is used in Ruby to test methods, classes and other parts of the code. It describes how code is suppose to work and lets it become more comprehensive to human understanding. 

2. Test-driven development: Is a process where tests are written before implimenting it in code. It describes what the code should do and finds the process of a correct code by creating a fail code before eventually getting a passing code to implement. 

3. CRUD: Stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 4 basic functions used when dealing with databases management.
